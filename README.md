# Mathlib 4 experiments

This is nothing to do with any official port of Lean 3 mathlib to Lean 4.
This is an entirely "unofficial" repo where me (and anyone else who wants
to join in) can try to port basic mathlib 3 files to Lean 4, because
such experiments help me to learn Lean 4. I do not expect this experiment
to be any part of the offical porting process, which will not occur
for some time yet. However I do expect this process to be fun, and if
we are lucky then it will inform the Lean 4 devs about how it works
compared to Lean 3.
